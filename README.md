# algo-examples
## National Technology Univeristy of Athens
### Some examples of algorithms created by me 
### during the courses of **Programming Languages I** 
### and **Algorithms and Complexity** 

This is a repository mostly to show case my programming assignments.
Each folder contains an **algorithmic puzzle** 
and a solution implemented in a programming language.
Test cases files and extra implementation may be provided.
